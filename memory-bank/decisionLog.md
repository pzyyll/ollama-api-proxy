## Decision

* [2025-06-07 22:34:30] - Fixed an `unusedwrite` error in `src/internal/config/config.go`. The loop iterating over `models.Models` was modified to use a pointer to the slice element, ensuring that the `baseModel` field assignment was not on a copy.
      
## Rationale 

* The original code iterated by value (`for i, model := range models.Models`), creating a copy of each `ModelInfo`. The subsequent assignment to `model.baseModel` modified the copy, not the original element in the slice, leading to the linter warning and incorrect behavior.

## Implementation Details

* The loop was changed from `for i, model := range models.Models` to `for i := range models.Models` with `model := &models.Models[i]` to get a direct pointer to the element in the slice. This ensures the assignment correctly modifies the original struct.
